        <p>
            Born and raised in Minas Gerais until the age of 18, with a childhood and adolescence in a small town and often in the countryside.

        <p>
            At 18 I had my first experience in a big city, I lived for almost a year in Campinas in the interior of São Paulo, working as a bartender at the Conceição snack bar, where he sold the best coxinha I've ever eaten; I went back home, but then I already missed the buildings and the climate of the big city. I went back with my sister and our time there was an adventure, a long story for another time. In short, we went to the city of Americana, where my sister stayed there and I came to São Paulo, where I live until today.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Here, I worked for a few years at an importer of baby carriages for 3 years, and then another 17 at Multfoco, an importer of optical products, where I grew up and specialized professionally as a technician, with skills in electronics, mainly in equipment maintenance. I worked another 5 years in the optics business as a technology representative in lens production and lens sales.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I specialized in electronics at the age of 27. At 37, I wanted to go to college in the IT area, but after 6 months I gave up, seeing that graduation would not bring me enough knowledge to enter a new profession as desired. So I moved on with my work, many trips across the country and some to Spain and Chile.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            At 47 things have changed a bit, and now writing this article, I realized that my life goes in cycles every 10 years that changes something... now determined to follow a new career, by force of will and for other reasons as well , I confess that I had a lot of difficulty, and doing this presentation as my first job, I have to consult information and I understand a little more, this area is an ocean of information that it is impossible to learn everything, I realized that and stopped wanting to know everything , it would take many lives and I don't know if a human being would be able to, that's why in this profession a lot of collaborative work is used, because 1 you just can't build large systems because they become too complex.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So since mid-2022, I started my training in software engineering and other courses related to front end development, where I'm starting.

            Well that was a little and summarized the story of my life. Thanks for taking the time to read this far.
